# SIMAGNA
Simulator of Magnetic Nanomaterials.


### Description 
The present code is the result of my phd. It s a code capable of determining the distribution of the magnetization of a system of magnetic particles with arbitraty shape. It is based on

* The minimization of the micromagnetic energy by the use of the lagrange multiplier technique.
* The weak form of the problem based on the Maxwell's equation for the system of a single cell.
